# Start poetry project

## Create Project:

```bash
poetry new auth-server
Change directory to project:
bash
Copy code
cd auth-server
Add dependencies in pyproject.toml file and run the following command:
bash
Copy code
poetry install
Add poetry virtualenv interpreter in VSCode
Write main.py, settings.py, models.py
Run tests:
bash
Copy code
poetry run pytest
Run project in Poetry Environment:
bash
Copy code
poetry run uvicorn auth_server.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Open in Browser:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json
Publish on the Web while running locally
Install Ngrok:
https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/

Run the following command to add your authtoken to the default ngrok.yml:
bash
Copy code
ngrok config add-authtoken 2bZGNZ3Mj3HdRxPt19defOl_7oFHsvr5AmM9A9UZUyhFn
Deploy with your static domain:
bash
Copy code
ngrok http --domain=my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app 8000
Open in Browser:
https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/
https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/docs
https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/openapi.json
Now we will use this json to create GPT Action.
Now create a Custom GPT here:
https://chat.openai.com/gpts

Add the following server URL in the openapi.json file generated by FastAPI and paste it into action schema:
json
Copy code
"servers": [
    {
        "url": "https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/"
    }
],
Now Let's Containerize the App
https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/

Create a Dockerfile.dev in the root directory
Checking to see if Docker is running:
bash
Copy code
docker version
Run hello_world for docker in cmd
bash
Copy code
docker run hello-world
Building the Image for Dev:
bash
Copy code
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t dev-auth:v.0.1 .
Check Images:
bash
Copy code
docker images
Verify config
bash
Copy code
docker inspect dev-auth:v.0.1
Running the Container for Dev:
bash
Copy code
docker run -d --name auth-cont1 -p 8000:8000 dev-auth:v.0.1
Check container is running
bash
Copy code
docker ps
Check all containers
bash
Copy code
docker ps -a
Check container logs
bash
Copy code
docker logs <containerName>
Check container logs in live mode
bash
Copy code
docker logs <containerName> -f    (-f mean follow live logs)
Stop container
bash
Copy code
docker stop <containerName or id>
docker kill <containerId or name>
Remove docker container
bash
Copy code
docker rm <containerName or id>
Restart container
bash
Copy code
docker start <container Id or name>
Test the Container
bash
Copy code
docker run -it --rm dev-auth:v.0.1 /bin/bash -c "poetry run pytest"
Let's start dev container
Install "dev containers" extension
Start your Docker engine by Docker Desktop app
Click on remote explorer
Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool specifically designed to simplify the development and management of applications that consist of multiple Docker containers.

Installing Docker Compose:
Docker Desktop includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI, and Docker Compose all in one package. Docker Desktop is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Use the following command to check which version is installed:

bash
Copy code
docker compose version
Docker Compose File
A Docker Compose file, written in YAML format, is the heart of defining and managing multi-container applications with Docker.

More about Docker Compose File

Running the application:
With this Compose file saved as compose.yml, you can use the following commands to manage your application:

bash
Copy code
docker compose up -d    # This builds the images (if needed) and starts the container in detached mode (background)
docker compose stop     # This stops the container
docker compose down     # This stops and removes the container
Connection String (added to the .env file)
Here's the connection string you can use to connect to the PostgreSQL database from another container running in the same Docker network:

bash
Copy code
postgresql://ziakhan:my_password@PostgresCont:5432/mydatabase
Install pgAdmin to connect to the Database
pgAdmin is the most popular and feature-rich Open Source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL.

Download and Install pgAdmin 4

Connect to our PostgreSQL Container:
Host name/address: localhost
Post: 5433 (note it is not the default 5432)
Maintenance database: mydatabase
Username: ziakhan
Password: my_password
