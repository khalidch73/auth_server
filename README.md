# Cloud Native Development with Docker Compose and Visual Studio Code

## Introduction:

Welcome to the world of cloud-native development! This README.md provides guidance on setting up a local development environment using Docker Compose and Visual Studio Code's dev container feature for real-time development.

### What is Cloud Native Development?

Cloud-native development refers to building and deploying applications that leverage cloud computing principles and technologies, such as microservices architecture, containers, and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. This approach enables developers to create scalable, resilient, and agile applications that can easily adapt to dynamic cloud environments.

### Why Use Docker Compose and Visual Studio Code?

- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose simplifies the management of multi-container applications by allowing developers to define and run complex environments with a single configuration file. It streamlines the setup of development, testing, and production environments, ensuring consistency across different stages of the development lifecycle.

- **Visual Studio Code Dev Containers**: Visual Studio Code's dev container feature provides an isolated and reproducible development environment within a container. It allows developers to work with tools, libraries, and dependencies specific to their project without worrying about conflicts or compatibility issues. Dev containers ensure consistency across development environments and facilitate collaboration among team members.

### Project Overview:

This project is a sample authentication server implemented using Python and FastAPI. It serves as a demonstration of cloud-native development practices, including containerization, local development environment setup, and real-time development using Visual Studio Code dev containers.

### Getting Started:

To get started with local development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Ensure Docker Engine is installed and running on your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the project using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

5. Once the project is running, open Visual Studio Code.
6. Navigate to the project directory and open it in a new window.
7. Visual Studio Code will detect the dev container configuration and automatically set up the development environment within the container.
8. You're now ready to start coding! Enjoy real-time development with Docker Compose and Visual Studio Code.


# Start poetry project

## Create Project:

```bash
poetry new auth-server
```

## Change directory to project:

```bash
cd auth-server
```

## Add dependencies in pyproject.toml file and run the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Add poetry virtualenv interpreter in VSCode

## Write main.py, settings.py, models.py

## Run tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## Run project in Poetry Environment:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn auth_server.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

## Open in Browser:

- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json](http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json)

## Publish on the Web while running locally

### Install Ngrok:

[https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)

### Run the following command to add your authtoken to the default ngrok.yml:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken 2bZGNZ3Mj3HdRxPt19defOl_7oFHsvr5AmM9A9UZUyhFn
```

### Deploy with your static domain:

```bash
ngrok http --domain=my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app 8000
```

### Open in Browser:

- [https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/](https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/)
- [https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/docs](https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/docs)
- [https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/openapi.json](https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/openapi.json)

### Now we will use this json to create GPT Action.

### Now create a Custom GPT here:

[https://chat.openai.com/gpts](https://chat.openai.com/gpts)

### Add the following server URL in the openapi.json file generated by FastAPI and paste it into action schema:

```json
"servers": [
    {
        "url": "https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/"
    }
],
```

## Now Let's Containerize the App

[https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/)

### Create a Dockerfile.dev in the root directory

### Checking to see if Docker is running:

```bash
docker version
```

### Run hello_world for docker in cmd

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

### Building the Image for Dev:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t dev-auth:v.0.1 .
```

### Check Images:

```bash
docker images
```

### Verify config

```bash
docker inspect dev-auth:v.0.1
```

### Running the Container for Dev:

```bash
docker run -d --name auth-cont1 -p 8000:8000 dev-auth:v.0.1
```

### Check container is running

```bash
docker ps
```

### Check all containers

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### Check container logs

```bash
docker logs <containerName>
```

### Check container logs in live mode

```bash
docker logs <containerName> -f    (-f mean follow live logs)
```

### Stop container

```bash
docker stop <containerName or id>
docker kill <containerId or name>
```

### Remove docker container

```bash
docker rm <containerName or id>
```

### Restart container

```bash
docker start <container Id or name>
```

### Test the Container

```bash
docker run -it --rm dev-auth:v.0.1 /bin/bash -c "poetry run pytest"
```

### Let's start dev container

- Install "dev containers" extension
- Start your Docker engine by Docker Desktop app
- Click on remote explorer

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool specifically designed to simplify the development and management of applications that consist of multiple Docker containers.

### Installing Docker Compose:

Docker Desktop includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI, and Docker Compose all in one package. Docker Desktop is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Use the following command to check which version is installed:

```bash
docker compose version
```

### Docker Compose File

A Docker Compose file, written in YAML format, is the heart of defining and managing multi-container applications with Docker.

[More about Docker Compose File](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/)

### Running the application:

With this Compose file saved as compose.yml, you can use the following commands to manage your application:

```bash
docker compose up -d    # This builds the images (if needed) and starts the container in detached mode (background)
docker compose stop     # This stops the container
docker compose down     # This stops and removes the container
```

### Connection String (added to the .env file)

Here's the connection string you can use to connect to the PostgreSQL database from another container running in the same Docker network:

```bash
postgresql://ziakhan:my_password@PostgresCont:5432/mydatabase
```

### Install pgAdmin to connect to the Database

pgAdmin is the most popular and feature-rich Open Source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL.

[Download and Install pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)

### Connect to our PostgreSQL Container:

- Host name/address: localhost
- Post: 5433 (note it is not the default 5432)
- Maintenance database: mydatabase
- Username: ziakhan
- Password: my_password
